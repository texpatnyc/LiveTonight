# LiveTonight
LiveTonight lets you know all the bands you can see in your city tonight and creates a Spotify Playlist of each artist's top tracks on spotify so you can give them a listen and decide who you want to go and see!

Check out the live version at [http://www.livetonight.io](http://www.livetonight.io).

## Motivation

I go see live music as often as possible and love discovering new bands live.  I wanted a way to be able to create a playlist of everything I could go see on a given night to put on in the background while I work so I can filter through and see who I would most want to go and see.
